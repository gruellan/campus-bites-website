      Campus Bites' service operates exclusively on Lancaster University's campus and we will not deliver to any
      address that is not on campus. We do not accept orders outside of our operating hours, which are subject to
      variation. Our current operating hours can be found on our
      <a href="/faq">FAQ page.</a> Although Campus Bites may
      be operating at a specific hour, our partnering restaurants may not be operating and therefore no order can be
      placed for that specific restaurant at that time.
    </p>

    <h2>Food Orders</h2>
    <p>
      Campus Bites does not cook any food ordered through our website, it is cooked and prepared by the employees of
      our partner restaurant. If you have any inquiries or comments about the food ordered through our website, please
      contact the respective partner restaurant. Campus Bites is not responsible for any problems with your food as our
      staff never directly touch your food.
    </p>
    <p>
      Campus Bites will only usually make deliveries to the entrance of any of the on-campus accommodation at Lancaster
      University. Our couriers will only enter the accommodation building if they have a compelling reason to do so e.g.
      the flat buzzer is only accessible inside the accommodation building.
    </p>

    <h2>Food Delivery</h2>
    <p>
      Campus Bites Ltd works continuously to deliver orders on time. You however understand that delivery timescales
      quoted to you are indicative only, and there is no guarantee of delivery within these timescales. We will not in
      any way be held liable for delayed delivery, howsoever arising. We do however aim to complete all of our orders
      within 30-40 minutes. If you believe that your food was delivered in an unreasonable time, please contact us via
      email at admin@campusbites.co.uk.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a client places an order, we record their phone number for the sole purpose of contacting the client
      regarding important updates about their order. We do not use our client 's phone number for any other purpose. If
      our courier cannot find you or your address, they may telephone you on your given number in order to get more
      details about your location.
    </p>
    <p>
      If our courier cannot locate you and/or your address, our courier will telephone you. If you fail to answer the
      phone call, then our courier will wait outside your specified address for 10 minutes. If you fail to collect your
      food from the courier within those 10 minutes then the courier will leave the premises and you will not be
      entitled to a refund for your order.
    </p>
    <p>
      Campus Bites will only usually make deliveries to the entrance of any of the on-campus accommodation at Lancaster
      University. Our couriers will only enter the accommodation building if they have a compelling reason to do so e.g.
      the flat buzzer is only accessible inside the accommodation building.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will not in any way be held responsible for a delayed or canceled order as a result of a client providing an
      incorrect telephone number, address or delivery location at checkout.
    </p>

    <h2>Delivery Information</h2>
    <p>
      You agree to provide the correct college name associated with your accommodation building and delivery address
      when prompted. You agree that failure to do so may result in Campus Bites cancelling your order and barring you
      from future use of our services.
    </p>

    <h2>Substitutions</h2>
    <p>
      All food items are subject to availability. Occasionally, one of our partner restaurants may be out of stock of
      an item that you ordered - if this occurs then the courier will telephone you and ask if you would like to
      substitute the item for an available one or if you would like the money for that specific food item refunded. If
      you choose to substitute an item which costs less than the original item, we will provide a partial refund for the
      difference in price.
    </p>

    <h2>Refunds</h2>
    <p>
      If you are entitled to a refund, you will be reimbursed within 7 working days. If you think you may be entitled
      to a refund, please contact us via email on admin@campusbites.co.uk.
    </p>

    <h2>Allergens</h2>
    <p>
      The restaurants listed on our website may use nuts in the preparation of certain Meals. Please call our Partner
      Restaurant prior to ordering if you have an allergy. Campus Bites cannot guarantee that any of the Meals sold by
      our Partner Restaurants are free of allergens.
    </p>

    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <p>
      Our couriers receive 100% of any tips they receive. If you receive exceptional service from one of our couriers
      then feel free to give them a tip. We do not inquire our couriers about any tips they receive since they are in
      complete control of any form of tip or gratuity they receive whilst delivering food.
    </p>

    <p>
      Campus Bites reserves the right to amend these terms and conditions of service at any time. It is your
